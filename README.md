# Investment Calculator Application

I developed this simple and basic investment calculator application to showcase my technical skills in using TypeScript's most important essential features. I see this as a TypeScript demo project where I can demonstrate how I can work with basic types and comile my TypeScript code file in to vanilla JavaScript code file in order to run my application locally and test to find out if the program works as expected and without any bugs or unexpected errors.
